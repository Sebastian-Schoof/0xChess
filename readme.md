# 0xChess
chess on a hexagonal board that is not patented

## where can I play?

this version is not hosted yet.
IOU a deployment for 100 stars :)

## how can I get up and running locally?

```
npm i && npm start
```
note however, that you need to host the frontend if you want to play in your local network
(e.g. by adding `server: { host: true },` the `vite.config.ts`)

## what's next for this project?

[ ] match making with friend codes
[ ] new "rendering" (the pixelation will vanish, probably even phaser)
[ ] enabling clock games
[ ] enabling correspondence games (incl. sessions, maybe even accounts)
