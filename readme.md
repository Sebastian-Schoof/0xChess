# 0xChess

chess on a hexagonal board that is not patented

## where can I play?

this version is not hosted yet.
IOU a deployment for 100 stars :)

## how can I get up and running locally?

```
npm i && npm start
```

note however, that you need to host the frontend if you want to play in your local network
(e.g. by adding `server: { host: true },` to the `vite.config.ts`)

## what's next for this project?

-   [ ] enable restraining diagonal movement
-   [ ] enable mirrored starting positions
-   [ ] enable randomised starting positions
-   [ ] enable WeGo mechanic
-   [ ] enable clock games
-   [ ] enable concurrent games (maybe even accounts)
-   [ ] make socket protocol more robust
